# PMN-P
Poor Mans NAS on Pi

The "Poor Mans NAS on Pi (PMN-P)" project is a GitHub repository focused on transforming a Raspberry Pi into a basic Network Attached Storage (NAS) system. The key features of this project include the use of a USB stick for storage, an automatic mounting (Automount) feature for the USB drive, and the capability to share the USB drive over a network. This setup is designed to be simple and cost-effective, leveraging the Raspberry Pi's capabilities to create a basic but functional NAS solution.
